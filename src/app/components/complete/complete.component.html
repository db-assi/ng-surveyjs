  <br>
  <span>Perimenopause means ‘around the menopause,’ and typically starts in a woman’s 40s. It is the time when signs and symptoms of falling oestrogen levels begin to show. Most commonly irregular periods or hot flushes. Perimenopause lasts until 12 months after your final menstrual period. For over half of women, the perimenopause stage lasts for over 7 years. This doesn’t mean you have to endure through symptoms for all that time as there are lots of treatments that can help! You can read more about the <a>stages of menopause here</a>.</span>

  <span>Based on what you told us you are likely <strong>post-menopausal.</strong></span>
  <br>
  <span>Post-menopause is the time from your last period (or surgery) onwards. As you are no longer ovulating, your ovaries' production of hormones, such as oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone, declines. As your body gets used to these lower levels of oestrogen, your body will adapt and stabilise, usually leading to reduced symptoms. You can read more about the <a>stages of menopause here</a>.</span>
